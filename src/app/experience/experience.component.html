                        As a Senior Frontend Developer at Prestassart, I led the development of "Acro Companion," a
                        gymnastics-focused application designed to make the sport more accessible and precise. I
                        implemented reactive Angular features with RxJS, integrated Firebase for real-time data
                        synchronization, and ensured robust state management using NgRx. My role also included writing
                        unit and end-to-end tests (Jest/Playwright) and mentoring junior developers in an Agile
                        environment.

                        At Lunar TC, I developed "Afrifont," a public-facing web app for free icon downloads using
                        Angular 17 and RxJS. I optimized performance through lazy loading, secured routes with Angular
                        Guards, and implemented NgRx for state management. Additionally, I contributed to CI/CD
                        pipelines (GitLab) and Agile ceremonies while ensuring code quality with SonarLint and
                        Playwright tests.

                        directly with business teams to align technical solutions with their needs and participated in
                        Agile ceremonies like Poker Planning for user story estimation.
